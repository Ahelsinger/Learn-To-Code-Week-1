## Overview
Our goal this week is to get build a website and publish it to the web. In order
to accomplish that goal we'll first need to setup a github account. If we have
time, we'll setup our developer environment and link it to our github account for
maximum developer points.

Here's what we'll be doing:

####  -Signing up for github and learning about git
####  -Forking and publishing our first project on github
####  -Overview of basic HTML concepts
####  -Overview of CSS concepts
maybe we will setup our dev environments if we have time*

# Lets Fork our first project on Github!
What does it mean to fork?

"A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea."
