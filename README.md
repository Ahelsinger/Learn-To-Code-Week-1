## Overview
Our goal this week is to get build a website and publish it to the web. In order
to accomplish that goal we'll first need to setup a github account. If we have
time, we'll setup our developer environment and link it to our github account for
maximum developer points.

Here's what we'll be doing:

####  -Signing up for github and learning about git
####  -Forking and publishing our first project on github
####  -Overview of basic HTML concepts
####  -Overview of CSS concepts
maybe we will setup our dev environments if we have time*

What does it mean to fork?
